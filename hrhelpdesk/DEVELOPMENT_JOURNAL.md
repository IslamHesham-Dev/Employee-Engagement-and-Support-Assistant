## üìù Entry #7 - Authentication Issue Diagnosis & Fix
**Date**: December 18, 2024  
**Actions**: Identified and fixed CORS configuration issue

### **Problem Found**
User reported "login failed" messages despite backend working correctly.

### **Full Investigation Results**
1. **Backend Health**: ‚úÖ Running on port 3000
2. **Database**: ‚úÖ Users exist (hr@iscore.com, employee@iscore.com)  
3. **API Endpoints**: ‚úÖ Login returns proper JWT tokens
4. **Frontend**: ‚úÖ Running on port 3001
5. **CORS Issue**: ‚ùå Backend configured for port 5173, frontend on 3001

### **Root Cause**
Backend server was started with old CORS configuration (`http://localhost:5173`) before `.env` file was updated to port 3001.

**Browser Error:**
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login' from origin 'http://localhost:3001' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://localhost:5173' that is not equal to the supplied origin.
```

### **Solution**
Restart backend server to pick up updated environment variables.

### **Test Credentials Confirmed Working**
- HR: hr@iscore.com / hrpassword123
- Employee: employee@iscore.com / employeepass123

### **Next**
User needs to restart backend server, then authentication should work perfectly

## üìù Entry #8 - Comprehensive Ports & Configuration Audit & Fix
**Date**: December 18, 2024  
**Actions**: Fixed critical environment loading and CORS configuration issues

### **Issues Found**
1. **Environment Variables Not Loading**: `dotenv.config()` wasn't finding `.env` file
2. **CORS Fallback Wrong**: Fallback was `http://localhost:5173` instead of `3001`
3. **DATABASE_URL Missing**: Backend couldn't connect to database
4. **Inconsistent Port References**: Some docs still referenced wrong ports

### **Root Cause**
Backend server `dotenv.config()` couldn't find the `.env` file because it was looking in wrong directory.

### **Fixes Applied**
1. **Fixed Environment Loading**:
   ```typescript
   dotenv.config({ path: path.join(__dirname, '../../.env') });
   ```

2. **Fixed CORS Fallback**:
   ```typescript
   origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN || 'http://localhost:3001'
   ```

3. **Added Environment Debug Logging**:
   - Shows which environment variables are loaded
   - Helps diagnose configuration issues

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Fixed frontend README port reference
   - Created environment verification script

### **Port Configuration Summary**
- **Backend**: Port 3000 ‚úÖ
- **Frontend**: Port 3001 ‚úÖ
- **CORS Origin**: http://localhost:3001 ‚úÖ
- **Database**: PostgreSQL port 5432 ‚úÖ

### **How to Test**
1. Restart backend server
2. Check console for environment debug logs
3. Test login with: hr@iscore.com / hrpassword123

### **Next**
Backend restart should resolve all authentication issues

## üìù Entry #11 - Critical Issues Resolution (FIXED)
**Date**: December 18, 2024  
**Actions**: Fixed authentication persistence and survey creation failures

### **Critical Issues Found & Fixed**
1. **üîß Survey Creation Failure**:
   - **Problem**: Question type mismatch (`'RATING'` vs `'RATING_SCALE'`)
   - **Root Cause**: Survey templates used `'RATING'` but database schema expected `'RATING_SCALE'`
   - **Fix**: Updated all survey templates to use `'RATING_SCALE'`

2. **üîß Authentication Persistence**:
   - **Problem**: Users logged out on page refresh
   - **Root Cause**: Frontend not restoring authentication state from localStorage
   - **Fix**: Enhanced auth slice initialization and user data persistence

3. **üîß Employee Fetch Working**:
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Backend endpoint working correctly
   - **Issue**: Frontend error handling or UI state issue

### **Technical Fixes Applied**
1. **Survey Type Consistency**:
   ```typescript
   // Changed from 'RATING' to 'RATING_SCALE'
   type: 'RATING_SCALE' | 'MULTIPLE_CHOICE' | 'TEXT'
   ```

2. **Authentication State Restoration**:
   ```typescript
   const initialState: AuthState = {
       isAuthenticated: !!localStorage.getItem('token'),
       user: localStorage.getItem('user') ? JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')!) : null,
       token: localStorage.getItem('token'),
   };
   ```

3. **User Data Persistence**:
   ```typescript
   localStorage.setItem('token', token);
   localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));
   ```

### **Backend Endpoint Test Results**
‚úÖ **HR Login**: Working  
‚úÖ **Employee Fetch**: Working  
‚úÖ **Survey Templates**: Working (5 templates)  
‚úÖ **Survey Creation**: **FIXED** - Creates surveys with 5 questions  
‚úÖ **All Surveys**: Working  

### **How to Test**
1. **Refresh browser** - Should stay logged in now
2. **HR Dashboard**:
   - Employee Management tab ‚Üí Should load employees
   - Survey Management tab ‚Üí Should create surveys successfully
3. **Employee Dashboard**:
   - Should see published surveys

### **Next**
