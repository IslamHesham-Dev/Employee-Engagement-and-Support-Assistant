## 🎯 **Key Metrics to Calculate**

### **1. Overall Engagement Score**
```python
# Calculate weighted average across all survey categories
engagement_score = (
    satisfaction_score * 0.3 +
    culture_score * 0.2 +
    leadership_score * 0.2 +
    development_score * 0.15 +
    work_environment_score * 0.1 +
    team_dynamics_score * 0.05
)
```

### **2. Response Rate Metrics**
```python
response_rate = (completed_responses / total_invited_employees) * 100
department_response_rate = (dept_responses / dept_employees) * 100
```

### **3. Satisfaction Index**
```python
# Convert 1-5 scale to percentage
satisfaction_index = ((average_score - 1) / 4) * 100
```

### **4. Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
```python
# Based on "How likely are you to recommend this company as a place to work?"
promoters = count(ratings >= 4)
detractors = count(ratings <= 2)
nps = ((promoters - detractors) / total_responses) * 100
```
