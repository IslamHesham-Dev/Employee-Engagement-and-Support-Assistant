## AI Prompt Engineering Strategy

### System Prompts

#### For HR Users
```
You are an AI assistant for HR professionals at iScore company. Your role is to:
1. Provide accurate information about company policies and procedures
2. Help with employee management guidance
3. Suggest best practices for HR scenarios
4. Escalate complex legal matters to human HR specialists

Guidelines:
- Always cite relevant policy documents
- Maintain confidentiality and privacy
- Provide actionable advice
- Suggest escalation when appropriate
```

#### For Employees
```
You are a helpful AI assistant for iScore employees. Your role is to:
1. Answer questions about company policies, benefits, and procedures
2. Provide guidance on leave requests, performance reviews, and career development
3. Help navigate company resources and contacts
4. Maintain a friendly, professional tone

Guidelines:
- Only share publicly available company information
- Direct sensitive inquiries to HR
- Encourage self-service when possible
- Maintain employee privacy
```

### Context Enhancement Prompts
```
Based on the user's role ({USER_ROLE}) and department ({DEPARTMENT}), 
provide information relevant to their specific needs. Consider:
- Department-specific policies
- Role-based responsibilities
- Relevant deadlines and procedures
- Available resources and contacts
```

## Integration Strategy

### 1. Non-Blocking Implementation
```javascript
// Main app continues to work if AI service is down
const chatService = {
  async sendMessage(message, userId) {
    try {
      return await aiService.processMessage(message, userId);
    } catch (error) {
      // Fallback to basic responses or human escalation
      return this.getFallbackResponse(message);
    }
  },
  
  getFallbackResponse(message) {
    return {
      message: "I'm currently unavailable. Please contact HR directly or try again later.",
      suggestedActions: ["Contact HR", "Browse FAQ", "Submit Ticket"]
    };
  }
};
```

### 2. Gradual Rollout Strategy
1. **Internal Testing:** HR team only
2. **Pilot Group:** Selected departments
3. **Phased Rollout:** Department by department
4. **Full Deployment:** All users

### 3. Monitoring and Fallbacks
- **Health Checks:** Regular AI service monitoring
- **Response Time Limits:** Timeout after 30 seconds
- **Human Escalation:** Seamless handoff to HR
- **Offline Mode:** Static FAQ responses

## Data Privacy and Security

### 1. Data Handling
- **Conversation Encryption:** End-to-end encryption
- **Data Retention:** Configurable retention policies

## Continuous Improvement

### 1. Analytics and Metrics
```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "responseAccuracy": "percentage",
    "userSatisfaction": "rating",
    "resolutionRate": "percentage",
    "averageResponseTime": "seconds",
    "escalationRate": "percentage"
  }
}
```

### 2. Learning Mechanisms
- **User Feedback:** Thumbs up/down on responses
- **Usage Patterns:** Track popular queries
- **Knowledge Gaps:** Identify unanswered questions
- **Document Updates:** Sync with policy changes

## Cost Management

### 1. AI API Usage Optimization
